# Reinforcement-Learning
Here's my Reinforcement Learning project, realized as a part of the RL course organized at the University of Edinburgh in summer semester 2023. It was developed within a framework from here: https://github.com/uoe-agents/uoe-rl2023-coursework.
In this project I implement the following Reinforcement Learning algorithms:
In the Question 1 
– Value Iteration
– Policy Iteration
In the Question 2 about Tabular Reinforcement Learning
– Q-Learning
– On-policy first-visit Monte Carlo 
As well as ϵ-greedy action selection
In the Question 3 about Deep Reinforcement Learning
– Deep Q-Networks
– Reinforce
As well as ϵ-scheduling strategies
In the Questions 4 and 5 about Continuous Deep Reinforcement Learning and fine-tuning
– Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for continuous RL
